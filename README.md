## 🚀 Overview  
This repository contains a **Machine Learning project** focused on solving real-world problems using data-driven approaches.  
The aim is to build **reproducible ML pipelines** with proper **EDA, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation**.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Perform **data cleaning & preprocessing**  
- Apply **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**  
- Engineer features for better model performance  
- Train and evaluate **multiple ML algorithms**  
- Use **hyperparameter tuning** to optimize results  
- Visualize and interpret model performance  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools  
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **ML Models**: Regression, Classification, Ensemble Methods  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, GitHub for version control

## 📊 Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing → Handle missing values, encoding, scaling  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) → Statistical summaries, visualizations  
3. Feature Engineering → PCA, feature selection, transformations  
4. Model Building → Train multiple ML models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)  
5. Evaluation → Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, RMSE, Cross-validation  
6. Hyperparameter Tuning → GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV
